# KingdomFarming
KingdomFarming is an online farmer-to-consumer marketplace designed to connect local farmers in Lesotho directly with consumers. The platform helps farmers reach wider markets, while giving consumers access to fresh produce at fair prices — all supported by an efficient logistics model inspired by last-mile delivery apps like Glovo.
